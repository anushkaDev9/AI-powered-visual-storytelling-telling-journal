# AI-powered-visual-storytelling-telling-journal
## Project Description:
The Visual Storytelling Journal is a web-based Single Page Application (SPA) that transforms usersâ€™
personal photo collections into engaging narrative storybooks. By integrating the Google Vision API,
the system extracts meaningful details such as objects, scenes, and text from images, while the Google
Gemini API weaves these insights into creative, diary-like narratives. Users can connect their Google
Photos or Pinterest accounts, select albums, and instantly generate unique storybooks that combine
visuals with AI-driven storytelling. All results are stored securely in Google Firestore, allowing users to
revisit, share, and personalize their journals, making photo memories more meaningful and
interactive.
